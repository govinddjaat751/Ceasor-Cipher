# Ceasor-Cipher
This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the Caesar cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

Features:
Encryption: Converts plaintext into ciphertext by shifting letters forward by a specified key.
Decryption: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext by shifting letters backward by the same key.
User Interaction: Prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption and input the text and key.

Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Select the operation: E for encryption or D for decryption.
3. Enter the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
4. Enter the key (an integer) for the Caesar cipher.
